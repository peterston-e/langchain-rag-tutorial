# Peter Faretra

Junior Software Developer

## Profile

As an enthusiastic junior web developer, I am passionate about tech, learning new skills and problem-solving. I discovered coding several years ago through a simple Google search: "What is an algorithm?" which led me on a deep dive into YouTube
tutorials and Harvard's CS50 course on computer science. Now after completing an intensive web development bootcamp at the School of Code, I am ready to realise my dream of transforming my passion into a career in tech.

Before transitioning into tech, I managed my own business as a painter and also worked as a professional sailor across Europe and America, where I learned a great deal about ethics, culture, loyalty, and maintaining the highest standards.

## Professional Experience

### Web Development Bootcamp

School Of Code - 02/2024 to 06/2024

SOC provides tailored full-stack web development training to equip students with the skills needed to start their careers as junior developers.

- Developed full-stack applications using APIs, React, Next.js continuous delivery, and web security.
- Pair programming, weekly hackathons and peer review presentations.
- Databases, cloud computing and AWS.
- Dev-ops, cybersecurity and automated testing.
- Ai, machine learning, vector search and RAG pipelines.
- Agile principles and practical application.

Every week, we collaborated as a team, brainstormed ideas and created projects in an Agile environment designed to prepare us for the workplace. I learned a lot about adapting to new technologies, collaborating in teams, DevOps and security.

The most challenging aspect of the course was overcoming the fear of failure. The most valuable lesson was learning to work as a team. Everyone became my teacher.

## Projects

### Birmingham Business Website Overhaul

School Of Code final project

Link to Live site: https://birmingham-biz-kappa.vercel.app/

Link to Github repository: https://github.com/peterston-e/birmingham-business

As a final project at the School of Code, we were tasked to work with real industry stakeholders: Birmingham Business Magazine. Their website was static and outdated, and the content was difficult to manage. My team and I rebuilt the entire site with perfect on-page SEO and a user-friendly content management system (CMS) called Strapi.

- Worked with stakeholders to define the scope of the problem and technical requirements.
- In Agile teams, we responded to feedback and built a continuous delivery pipeline to our live site.
- We used pair programming, wire-framing, Disney ideation, unit testing, SEO analysis, and team rotations to ensure everyone understood the whole project.
- Deployed a headless CMS with a Postgres database along with a dynamic Next.js/React frontend to the cloud.

Tech stack: React, Next.js, Strapi CMS, Vercel, Jest, Analytics, Railway, Figma, Postgres.

### The Weather App

Personal Project

Live site: https://www.peterfaretra.rocks/weather-app

GitHub repository: https://github.com/peterston-e/my-portfolio/tree/main/app/weather-app

A simple weather app that uses the device Geolocation interface of a web browser
to determine user location and provide the latest weather conditions. The
application makes two API calls - one to retrieve the weather updates and another to
a reverse geo-locater that provides the name of the local area based on the grid
reference.

I really enjoyed making this little app for the simple reason that I found it
challenging. It took quite a while to get the user location working and it represents a
milestone in my journey as a developer.

I began the project in simple HTML and JavaScript and then converted it to a Next.js
application using React and TypeScript

Tech stack: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Next.js, Vercel

### Decorating Price Calculator

Personal Project

Figma link: https://www.figma.com/design/zdehxSJZ59R2siq33nALcx/Lofi-D-Mask?node-id=0-1&t=9wIEQJAHpoE0Lu9E-1

GitHub repository: https://github.com/peterston-e/painting-quote-price-generator-AWS

A very exciting project for me because it addresses a real pain point that I experienced working as a decorator.

- Revolutionise the painting and decorating quote process with a time and labour-saving app that prices jobs based on simple room dimensions.
- Design and build a database to store jobs of varying size and complexity.
- Create a modern ergonomic frontend, mobile-friendly and ready to use on job sites.
- Continuous delivery pipeline using GitHub Actions to AWS EC2 instance.

Presently, I have a Next.js app deployed to AWS with a database with UI designs on
Figma. But, the project is still under construction.

Tech stack: AWS, React, Next.js, PostgeSQL, Figma,JavaScript

## Future Project Goals

- Build a blockchain ticketing system that would eliminate the need to pay fees to companies like Ticketmaster.

- Implement a RAG pipeline on my portfolio that is trained on my data and allows people to learn about me.

- Make a mobile app that taps into Rightmove and the House sale price that gives you the current house prices and price history for the device location, just like the weather app.

## Professional Background

### Painting and Decorating

Self-employed - 2012 to 2024

Running my own business was a privilege that gave me huge self-respect and a feeling of real independence. It was never my ideal career, but it provided financial stability and allowed me to pursue my true passion for coding.

- Delivering complicated projects on time to exact specifications.
- Relationship building on all levels including suppliers contractors and clients.
- Meticulous attention to detail to deliver a service of the highest standard.

### Superyachts and other Boats

Deckhand, Deck Engineer, Officer of the Watch - 2003 to 2012

I had the pleasure of working on many boats all around the world. It was some of the best years of my life - full of adventure, wild oceans and amazing stories.

- Officer Of The Watch driving the Atlantic crossings two times.
- Earthrace to breaking the world circumnavigation record.
- European Union Fisheries Observer onboard the Spanish beam trawler, monitoring quotas.

My experience working on boats taught me what it really means to be self-reliant and built a strong sense of resilience and determination, which are essential for overcoming any challenge.

## Achievements

- Broke the world record to circumnavigate the globe in a
  carbon-neutral wave-piercing trimaran. 60 days, 23 hours and 49 min.
- Three Atlantic crossings as watch keeper on two different boats, logged over 23,000 sea miles.
- Ran the Manchester Marathon in 4 hours and 30 minutes.

## Education

BSc Biological Sciences from the University of Plymouth.

## Interests

- Storytelling and the “hero’s journey” because it’s fascinating to see the common thread among all stories around the world and then see it play out in real life.
- Foraging for wild plants and mushrooms. It is a great way to spend time outdoors and gives you a deeper understanding of the environment.
- Running and keeping fit, however, learning to code has meant I have let my fitness go a little. I will get it back.
